<p>In Buildium, you can enter and process credits from a vendor. The amount due to the vendor will be reduced by the amount of the credit issued.</p>
<p>After a vendor issues a credit to you, you must enter the credit information in the Buildium system. <a class="MCXref xref " href="/hc/en-us/articles/200690168">see "Vendor credits"</a> for more information.</p>
<p>After you have entered a credit, you can then redeem the credit by applying the credit against an outstanding bill. <a class="MCXref xref " href="/hc/en-
